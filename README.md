# presentation-demo-app
Spring-boot 2 🚀 + Thymeleaf ☘️ containerised application for demo purposes

## Mortivation 💡

I was looking for a simple monolothic application with CRUD ability, file upload with a nice user interface. Unfortunately there was no simple modular application as such I could find on github. So I decided to develop this application which has least dependencies. 

## Demo 📺

TBD

## How to run 🏃

## Contributions 🤝

Contributions are most welcome! Please make sure any changes you do, the intention of this application to work as expected where there is ❌ **no internet access**(unless you explictly integrate external services)
