# presentation-demo-app
Spring-boot 2 🚀 + Thymeleaf ☘️ containerised application for demo purposes

## Motivation 💡

I was looking for a simple monolithic application with CRUD ability, file upload with a nice user interface. Unfortunately there was no simple modular application as such I could find on github. So I decided to develop this application which has least dependencies. 

## Demo 📺
